# Pickem Bot

A proof of concept for a bot that makes it fun to place and share your csgo major picks with your friends. 
I wrote this in 2 days during a major because I quickly needed something for my discord server. 

If I were to make a more permanent bot I'd probably rewrite it in typescript. The discord.net wrapper works pretty well but it's not officially supported by Discord.
